## Alloy Sounds: Blending sounds using probabilistic cellular automata

A method that allows blending sounds in the spectral domain. The method is based on using probabilistic cellular automata in spectral band, so that the state of the automaton corresponds to the sound that plays in that band. The probabilistic cellular automata evolve in a non-repeating, yet controlled pattern, generating sound blends whose spectral behavior works similarly to the textures in marble or to the patterns drawn by fire in a burning leaf. This technique generates a family of sounds that are called Alloy Sounds. They are designed with a focus on their musical semantics, and, in addition, create interesting sound variations.
